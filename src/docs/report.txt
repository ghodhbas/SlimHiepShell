Project Created by Slim Ghodhbane & Hiep Le


Group 1:
    +:
        -implemented the possibility to add and remove environment variables
        -added a name for the shell 
        -added the ability to change the name
    obst:
        -understanding the environ variable that stored environment variables awas a challenge
        -making sure that a library functione xists before coding it from scratch
    learned:
        -utility of environment variables



Group 2:
    +:  
        - Implement exec to look for programs within the PATH
        - Implement program to look for $
        - If $ found, replace all env variables with their corresponding values
    Obstacles:
        - Thinking about how to work within the built_in function (what value to return)
    Learned:
        - How Echo and $ works


Group 3:
    +:
        -set the first child (job) pgid to it's own pid so that every child of this job will have the same pid (different than the pid of shellex)
        -implemented SIGINT


    Obstacles:
        if we set the child pgid to pid then we need to manually kill the processes unless we implement the handler which kills the pgid 
        -fixing SIGTSTP
